# Rust Book Tutorial - My Journey

This repository contains the code I wrote while working through the excellent [Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
I recently completed the tutorial, and I wanted to document my experience and summarize what I learned.

## What I Learned

Going through the book was realy interesting introduction to Rust. Some of the key concepts I grasped include:

*   **Memory Safety:** Rust's ownership system and borrow checker enforce memory safety at compile time, preventing common errors like dangling pointers, data races, and buffer overflows.
*   **The Rust Compiler:** The compiler is incredibly helpful, providing clear and informative error messages that guide you towards correct code. It felt like having a helpful mentor constantly pointing out potential issues.
*   **Threads:** I explored Rust's concurrency features, learning how to create and manage threads safely and efficiently. The ownership system plays a crucial role here, preventing data races and ensuring thread safety.
*   **Basic Syntax and Concepts:** Of course, I also learned the fundamentals of Rust syntax, data types, control flow, structs, enums, traits, and more.

## Overall Experience

Working through the Rust book was a fun and rewarding experience.
The concepts were challenging but also very satisfying to learn.
I especially appreciate the focus on memory safety and the power of the compiler.
I'm excited to continue exploring Rust and build more complex projects with it.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to mirror the structure of the book, with each chapter's exercises and examples in their respective directories.

## Running the Code

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Rust installed. You can download and install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, you can navigate to a specific project directory and run it using the following command:

```bash
cargo run
